# AI-ML-Project
An implementation of a preprocessed dataset to be used in developing a hybrid deep learning framework for robust zero-day network anomaly detection.

In line with the specified requirements for this project, the report detailing the intricacies of the project was submitted via Moodle and the Jupyter Source file was uploaded to GitHub.

However, I was unable to upload the final datasets obtained after preprocessing due to the extremely large size of the datasets. Should the datasets be required at any time, I would be glad to upload them onto a data hosting service like Dropbox.
